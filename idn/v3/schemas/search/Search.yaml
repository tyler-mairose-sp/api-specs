  searchAfter:
    description: >-
      Used to begin the search window at the values specified.

      This parameter consists of the last values of the sorted fields in the current record set.

      This is used to expand the Elasticsearch limit of 10K records by shifting the 10K window to begin at this value.

      For example, when searching for identities, if the last idenitity ID in the search result is 2c91808375d8e80a0175e1f88a575221, then using that ID in this property will start a new search after this identity.
