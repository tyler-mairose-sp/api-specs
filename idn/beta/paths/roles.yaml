    This API creates a Role.

    There is a soft limit of 800 roles per org in IdentityNow.  You will receive an error if you attempt to add more than 800 roles via the API or the UI.  If you need to add roles above this limit, please create a support ticket.

    A token with API, ORG_ADMIN, ROLE_ADMIN, or ROLE_SUBADMIN authority is required to
    call this API. In addition, a ROLE_SUBADMIN may not create a Role including an Access Profile if that Access Profile
    is associated with a Source with which the ROLE_SUBADMIN is not themselves associated.

    The maximum supported length for the description field is 2000 characters.
    Longer descriptions will be preserved for existing roles, however, any new roles as well as any updates to existing descriptions will be limited to 2000 characters.
